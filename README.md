# Hello-World
First created repository for testing
I plan on keeping it that very un original name, just as a reminder of starting from the beginning.

I am not quite sure how to use GitHub to its fullest, but using this for notes and things I am working on as I try to expand my coding knowledge
Java Projects:
  Temp converter
  Recipe Keeper
Learning Android Studio now.
